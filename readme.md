# Text-to-sound Synthesis
This is the open source code for our paper "Diffsound: discrete diffusion model for text-to-sound generateion". We will release all of the code, pre-trained models as soon as possible.

## Overview


## Pretrained Model
We release four text-to-sound pretrained model. Including VQVAE trained on Audioset, Vocoder trained on Audioset, generation model trained on Audiocaps and Audioset.
